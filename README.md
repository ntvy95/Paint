I am sharing the souce code of a very-not-good-but-worked project that I have to develop when I took Computer Graphics in my university.

I have designed GUI from scratch using BGI and OOP, though I do not think this is a good reference overall (due to the limited developing time: 8-week with tons of other projects needing to be developed concurrently), still it has some reusable graphic algorithms that can be found in Algorithm.cpp file.

Have fun.
